# About

General purpose unit converter that allows the user to add custom units, the units are then saved as cookies. The entire app is one front-end file that can be saved and ran locally.
The converter works by defining a unit as an amount of base unit, for example, 1kg is used as the base unit, it's conversion rate is defined as 1. 1g is defined as 1000, and 1 ton is defined as 0.001.

# note: 
some conversions may be incorrect, rounding errors may also be present so this is not a scientific calculator. Feel free to message with any feedback, or fix any conversion rates that are wrong!
